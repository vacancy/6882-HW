## Main text: Tomas' Jokes

### Week 2

- Jokes!!

### Week 3

- we can make some cardboard people (show open their cameras in Zoom)
- this is an update of Leslie's picture, more scifi
- so these Zoom jokes just don't work, isn't it?
- you can always blame that on Tom
- (can I ask a question?) you have to pay extra though

### Week 4

- Leslie and I know the author of this book. We don't know why he comes up with this stuff (erratic vaccum cleaner)
- there is no mark on the screen any more, it never happened
- (now you've understand this erratic vaccum cleaner example), the whole career is opened up for you
- we've get through the easy stuff and next week we will get to the harder stuff, just kidding

- we will go through a wired problem now, just to confuse you guys
- (Leslie: use your brain or use the algorithm) use your brain if you have one, or use the algorithm
- I did a small version of this problem until I have the patience for
- in a week, Leslie will talk about enough POMDP that you will ever want to hear
- everything is cristal clear? or no finite set of questions can clarify it for you

- (talking about the pits in Wumpus world) it's not Brad Pit, it's a bad pit. (Did you prepare it beforehand?) No it just came to me, it's a bad pit
- I am just demonstrating sophisticated inference here
