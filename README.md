## Main Text: Tomas' Jokes

### Week 2

- Jokes!!

### Week 3

- we can make some cardboard people 
- this is an update of Leslie's picture, more scifi
- so these Zoom jokes just don't work, isn't it?
- you can always blame that on TOM
- (can I ask a question?) you have to pay extra though

### Week 4 

- next we will see a weird question, just to confuse you
- in a few weeks we will learn from Leslie enough about POMDP that you are ever want to hear
- (Tom) if there is any mistake, we can always blame Tom
- (erasing his mistakes on the whiteboard) you see there are no marks, so nothing has happened
- (Leslie: should we use the brain or the algorithm) use the brain if you have it, otherwise using the algorithm

### Week 5

- we personally know the authors. i have no idea how they come up with this () example
- (talking about the wumper world example) here we have the pits, not Brad pit, but Bad pit. (Tom: did you prepare this joke beforehand) no, I just came up with it. Not Brad pit, but Bad pit. 
- (Leslie) i am just demonstrating sophisticated inference here
- (student just came in for lecture) any final questions?
