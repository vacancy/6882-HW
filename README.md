## Main Text: Tomas' Jokes

### Week 2

- Jokes!!

### Week 3

- we can make some cardboard people 
- this is an update of Leslie's picture, more scifi
- so these Zoom jokes just don't work, isn't it?
- you can always blame that on TOM
- (can I ask a question?) you have to pay extra though

### Week 4

- Leslie and I know the author of this book. We don't know why he comes up with this stuff (erratic vaccum cleaner)
- there is no mark on the screen any more, it never happened
- (now you've understand this erratic vaccum cleaner example), the whole career is opened up for you
- we've get through the easy stuff and next week we will get to the harder stuff, just kidding

- we will go through a wired problem now, just to confuse you guys
- (Leslie: use your brain or use the algorithm) use your brain if you have one, or use the algorithm
- I did a small version of this problem until I have the patience for
- in a week, Leslie will talk about enough POMDP that you will ever want to hear
- everything is cristal clear? or no finite set of questions can clarify it for you

### Week 5

- (talking about the pits in Wumpus world) it's not Brad Pit, it's a bad pit. (Did you prepare it beforehand?) No it just came to me, it's a bad pit
- (Leslie) i am just demonstrating sophisticated inference here
- (student just came in for lecture) any final questions?

### Week 6

- Since you are not confused enough, here is ...
- (Temporarily) You wish that you lost me. That was wishful thinking
- (Tom) Now I am going to break out the rooms, unless Leslie and Tomas ... (Tomas) No you are the boss. (Leslie) You have to do your homework, I don't know how to do that. (Tom) I have to do everything around here. Ok. (Tomas) Can you clean up the rooms afterwards?
